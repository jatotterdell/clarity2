# To Do - 2021-11-19

To do list following meeting on 2021-11-19:

- [ ] change the observed outcome distribution to that from Clarity 1.0 open report
- [ ] vary number of interims (300, 450, 600)
- [ ] allow for dropping of control arms after an analysis if they are found to be inferior to the investigational arm (pairwise comparison rather than joint comparison)
- [ ] investigate targeting Type I error of 0.025 and 0.05
- [ ] explore stage 2 as two-arm trial assuming that one control is always removed following stage 1, e.g. due to external results.
- [ ] possibly incorporate the differential allocation in first 600 (520 1:1:1 between 3 arms, 80 1:1 between two).
